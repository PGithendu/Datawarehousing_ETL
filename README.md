To effectively utilize and extract value from available data, it must first be integrated into an IT system. This means unifying and standardizing data from various sources so it can be used by other programs. One way to accomplish this is by implementing a Data Warehouse.
In this project, we will design and implement a Data Warehouse using call data from ServiceSpot â€“ an IT Company that has requested an analysis of their call center data.  The task is to develop an Extract Transform & Load (ETL) project with SSIS that will load data into a new enterprise data warehouse.
